### 1. Predicting Employee Attrition using R

**Project:**

**Objective:** To predict employees likely to leave

**Description:** 
The project delves into an employee dataset from 2018, encompassing demographic details, job satisfaction indicators (such as workload, years of experience, salary level, etc.), job-specific information (including location, business travel), and other pertinent data. 
The project leverages supervised learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and Lasso regression, and evaluates their effectiveness by using the False Negative Rate. Emphasizing the false negative rate, the project prioritizes minimizing instances of incorrectly predicted negative outcomes.

In principle, the project follows this framework: <br>
Uncertainty: 	Employee exits or Employee stays <br>
Business Deployment: Target employees with employee benefits <br>
Goal: $E[Profit|X,D] = P(Employee stays | X,D) * V(X,D)$

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Predictive Modelling, Supervised Learning

**Technology:** R, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Lasso Regression

### 2. Face Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

**Project:**

**Objective:** To recognize identities given an image

**Description:** 
This project leverages facial embeddings, the VGG Face Model, and CNNs to accurately identify facial embeddings and predict identities from a pool of 105 identities. The resulting "SoftMax classifier Model" was trained on the Pins Face Recognition Dataset from Kaggle, which comprised 17,534 faces across 105 identities. The VGG Face model was first used to extract facial embeddings, which were then passed through a neural network outfitted with ReLu activation, Batch Normalization, and regularization techniques. 

**Skills:** Creating Metadata, Image Augmentation, Data Preprocessing, CNN model, hyperparameter tuning, Model Evaluation

**Technology:** PyTorch, Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Sckit-Learn), Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Google Cloud Platform(GCP)

### 3. Data Visualization of Flight Delays
